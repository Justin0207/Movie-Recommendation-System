## Overview
This project focuses on developing a content-based movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The recommendation system suggests movies to users based on the content similarity between movies and user preferences. By analyzing movie attributes such as genres, actors, directors, etc., the system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations tailored to each user's tastes. The deployed app can be accessed using this link [https://movie-recommendation-system-jhhsypav94aitp5ka6k8ee.streamlit.app/].

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about over 9800 movies and their attributes. It includes features such as movie titles, genres, release years, etc. The dataset may be obtained from the Kaggle database.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.  
- Content-Based Filtering: Implements a content-based recommendation algorithm that suggests movies similar to others based on their movie overview.
  
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features  from movie attributes such as movie overview and genre and then transforming them into suitable formats.
  
- Model Development: Develops and trains the content-based recommendation model based on the similarities of the movies in the preprocessed dataset.  
- Deployment: Deploys the recommendation system in a production environment for real-time movie recommendations.

## Technologies Used
